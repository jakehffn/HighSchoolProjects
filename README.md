# High School Projects

These are projects which I created in high school. 

All README files were created much later than the original projects were, but the code is generally untouched. The only exception to this I can currently think of is the SnakeGameCpp project. I started that in high school, and then refactored it when I used it again for a college assignment. I fixed several bugs and origanized some of the functions, but did not really change the class structure. 

My first website, jaketh.com, was started in highschool, but I continued to make minor changes to it up until my freshman year of college. At that point I created another website, but I have never been super great at maintaining any of my personal websites or keeping them relavent.

I don't think the code in these projects is amazing, but I want to keep a record of it somewhere.
