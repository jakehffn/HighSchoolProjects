# Fluid Simulator

This is an attempt at recreating a fluid simulation that was originally created by Jos Stam based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The original implementation was done in C, and I have attempted to recreate it in Java. I am not sure how well it works, but the results look nice regardless.
