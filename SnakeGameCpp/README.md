# Snake in Cpp
This is the traditional snake game written in Cpp. I wrote this a while ago, so I am not sure about the quality of the code. 

*note: I think I fixed most of the issues including code style. The only remaining issues concern the overall structure.*

## Running
This program uses graphics provided by SDL2. In order to use those, there is a cmake file included which finds your installation of SDL2. 


### Linux
Before running you must have SDL2 installed. Within the build directory run these commmands:
```
cmake ..
make
./SnakeGame
```
